_Created for the Immerse the Bay 2023 hackathon at Stanford University. Originally based on the YOLOv8 repo._

# RAIDAR
Raidar is an augmented reality (AR) device that integrates XReal glasses and an RGB Orbec camera mounted on a bicycle helmet. We embedded ONNX-Yolov8-object-detection to track and identify objects in the scene. Our algorithm is capable of classifying over 200 distinct objects in real-time.

## Motivation
The Raidar helmet was developed as a tool to help cyclists navigate the 21st century. We blended android powered XReal glasses, Orbec monocular camera, ONNX-yolov8 object detection to help cyclists tackle 3 distinct problems: 🔦 Visibility, dangerous - identify barriers, and how close they are, 🌏Confusion- navigation, to destination, 💕 unengaging - heads up display, biometrics. Radar in the dark, aid to get where you want, AI in AR technology.

Cycling, which is a sport and means of transportation that we enjoy, has ceased to be a hobby that people enjoy day by day. With the ideation and research phase we carried out, we saw how many problems bikers actually have with observational research. Based on this problem, we determined a statement and storyboard for ourselves. After creating our personas, the problem statement was actually clear in our minds. Afterwards, when we thought about how we could find a solution to this problem, how we could get people to ride bicycles again and enjoy doing so, we actually started to create our demo product.

## Testing and validation
The solution was tested in the early hours of 12 November 2023 at Stanford University.
